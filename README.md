# Knowledge Graphs With ROS

- This project integrates Neo4j RAG with ROS, letting the user navigate the world of art with robots.
- The program requires a Neo4j database of art pieces (with descriptions and real life coordinates), and a BWI bot.
- The python ROS node takes the user to the art piece that fits their interests the most, based on previous conversations.

### This is a UT Austin FRI I 2024 final project
Collaborators are Riley Gonzalez and Justin Meiners
